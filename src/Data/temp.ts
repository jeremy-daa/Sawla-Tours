You can choose to arrive by air this morning with Ethiopian Airlines or by another carrier, or you can elect to arrive the previous day and get some rest by having an extra hotel night. If you arrive early enough you can explore the city if you wish. There are plenty of interesting things to see, including Emperor Menelik’s tomb, the cathedral, the national museum and the huge and fascinating Mercato open-air market.",

It is rich in waterbirds, including Great White Pelicans, Common Cranes and many others, but if not we will press on to Lake Koka, often a great site for photographing impressive (and noisy) African Fish Eagles and sometimes the beautiful Black Crowned Crane. There are often so many eagles here that fights over fish break out.",
            "This afternoon we will arrive at Lake Ziway, where we will overnight at a comfortable hotel right at the lakeside. Lake Ziway is a great place for photography, and of course of a kind we will not enjoy while in the Bale or Simien. We can walk out directly onto either of two promontories that start at our hotel and enjoy the spectacle of numerous waterbirds, most of which are highly approachable. (An important aspect of Ethiopia, and one which makes it so good for wildlife photography, is that birds and indeed most creatures are not harmed by local people.)",
            "Large flocks of Great White Pelicans are a feature here and we are likely to get surprisingly close to these huge and impressive birds. Among the many other stars are the jewel-like Malachite Kingfisher, the long-toed African Jacana, the huge Goliath Heron, the strange Hamerkop and the superb Saddle-billed Stork. Additional species we are likely to shoot include White-faced and Fulvous Whistling Ducks, Spur-winged and Egyptian Geese, Hottentot Teal, Pink-backed Pelican, Reed Cormorant, African Darter, African Sacred and Glossy Ibises, Yellow-billed Stork, Black-winged Stilt, Spur-winged Lapwing, Gull-billed and White-winged Terns, Red-eyed Dove and Pied Kingfisher (try and take them hovering).

The grounds of a rather run-down hotel usually hold impressive Greyish Eagle-Owls and many cryptically-coloured Slender-tailed Nightjars, and while looking for these nightbirds we are likely to find and photograph the endemic Black-winged Lovebird and Red-throated Wryneck, as well as Namaqua Dove, White-bellied Go-away-bird, the weird-looking Speckled Mousebird, Little Bee-eater, Eurasian Hoopoe, Black-billed Wood Hoopoe, and colourful Greater Blue-eared, Rüppell’s and Superb Starlings.",
            "From Langano we continue south to the town of Shashamane for lunch and then, during the late afternoon, we will explore the rarely-visited Senkelle Wildlife Sanctuary, the last stronghold of the endemic Swayne’s Hartebeest. These impressive chestnut-coloured antelopes are still common here and the grasslands also feature White-bellied Bustard and the gorgeous Northern Carmine Bee-eater. Eventually, we will arrive at Hawassa, a town situated beside the lake of the same name, where we will overnight.",

Beautiful, black and white Guereza Colobus monkeys with long bushy tails frequent the area and, since the hotel staff gives them a few tidbits, are very confiding, allowing for great shots. Mothers with tiny infants are especially appreciated. Grivet Monkeys also occur here and the more photogenic birds include the delightful little African Pygmy Goose, Squacco Heron, the perky little Black Crake and Woodland Kingfisher. African Spotted Creeper, a very uncommon and patchily-distributed bird, also occurs here, but we cannot honestly claim it will be at the top of most folk’s targets!",

We will spend a little time here to enjoy the spectacle before our thoughts turn to high mountains almost empty of people.",

            "We will be spending much of our time exploring the wild and spectacular Afro-alpine moorlands of the high Sanetti Plateau, one of the best places in the Bale Mountains for finding Ethiopian Wolf. The handsome Ethiopian (or Simien) Wolf has had a difficult time in recent decades, suffering from distemper epidemics introduced by domestic dogs (incursions of which have become more common as the region’s human population has increased). This is now the world’s rarest canid, although, happily, a recent campaign to vaccinate local dogs, organized by the Ethiopian Wolf Conservation Programme has brought about a welcome rebound in the population.",
            "The wolves tend to go around singly or in small groups and during the course of our visit we should have repeated encounters with them, watching them patrol their territories, greet each other, relax or hunt rodents and other prey. While we should be able to see them catch rodents, you can consider yourself lucky if you witness a close-up ‘kill’ and likewise, although most packs will have pups this season, getting great photo opportunities with cubs must be considered a real bonus.",
            "The number of rodents here is quite extraordinary, and of course, they provide a bonanza for predators. It is estimated that their density is such that the combined weight of rodents per square kilometre (or about 0.4 square mile) is no less than 4 tons! The great majority on the moorlands (and the main prey species of the Ethiopian Wolf) consist of three Ethiopian endemics: Blick’s Grass Rat, Black-clawed Brush-furred Rat and the extraordinary, endangered Giant Mole Rat. The latter, a huge blind rodent with very goofy teeth, is constantly enlarging its burrows to reach new food supplies and we will have some fun trying to sneak up on them to take some photos. They have good hearing and also detect vibrations, so in spite of their blindness, a close approach is not easy!",
            "While the handsome Mountain Nyala is regularly seen on the moorlands, the landscape is open and approaching them closely on foot is often unsuccessful. For far better opportunities we will head for the Bale Mountains National Park headquarters at Dinsho. Here, some of the Nyalas have become unafraid of humans and will allow a close approach, as will Menelik’s Bushbucks and especially the ultra-tame Common Warthogs, which one can get to within a couple of meters!",
            "Dinsho is also a good place for bird photography, often including African Wood Owl, the huge Verreaux’s Eagle-Owl and the uncommon endemic Abyssinian Owl. (Cape Eagle-Owls also occur here, but are usually too distant for good images.)",

The dramatic, castle-style palaces built over a period of more than 150 years reveal the influence of Axumite, Indian and even Portuguese and Moorish architecture in Ethiopia.",

The drive between Gondar and Debark is very scenic, particularly at Kosoye some 32km (20 miles) north of Gondar, where Queen Elizabeth II of England camped in 1965 while driving between Gondar and Axum.",

The park is home to the highest peak in the country, Ras Dashen, which is 4543 meters (14,906ft) above sea level.",

            "In addition to its wonderful scenery and wildlife, the park is also famous for its Afromontane forest, Hypericum woodland, Afromontane grassland and Afro-alpine moorland dominated by Giant Lobelias, Red Hot Pokers, tree heaths, and giant St. John’s Wort and African Roses. As you can see, no Ethiopia wildlife photography tour can afford to miss out on the extraordinary Simien!",
            "We will explore the scenic Simien escarpment in order to find the endemic Gelada Baboons. Nicknamed ‘bleeding heart baboon’ and ‘lion-monkey’ for reasons that will soon be obvious to all, Gelada Baboons are peculiar to Ethiopia and Eritrea, still being numerous in the Simien Mountains. Geladas are mainly vegetarian, living on herbs, grasses and roots, but they also eat insects including locusts. Geladas live along the rim and steep slopes of the escarpment, which is their refuge when danger threatens.",
            "On one or more days, after an early breakfast, we will leave the lodge for Chenek guard post, taking a picnic lunch. The scenery around Chenek is even more awesome than further west near our lodge, with huge peaks, crags and cliffs in the foreground and distant granite domes below the Simien escarpment. Here we can look for the endemic Walia Ibex. As well as photographic opportunities with the ibex, we will also be hoping for an encounter with the handsome Ethiopian (or Simien) Wolf, a declining species that still occurs regularly around Chenek.",

            "Birdlife is rich and varied (over 400- species have been recorded from Awash) and among the most appealing photographic targets are the huge Lappet-faced Vulture, Tawny Eagle, Pallid and Montagu’s Harriers, Pygmy and Lanner Falcons, Kori, Buff-crested and White-bellied Bustards, Black-headed Lapwing, Chestnut-bellied Sandgrouse, Blue-naped Mousebird, the superb Abyssinian Roller, the wonderful Northern Carmine Bee-eater (which sometimes uses the backs of Kori Bustards or even Somali Ostriches as a convenient lookout!), Northern Red-billed and Eastern Yellow-billed Hornbills, and the lovely Rosy-patched Bushshrike (pairs often duet together).",
            "This afternoon we will penetrate further into the Awash region, to the Bilen area for a two-night stay. This interesting area is inhabited by Afar people who were formerly nomadic herders but now live a more settled existence, although they continue to use the long, rounded thatched dwellings that they used while moving from one area of pasture to another.",

Interestingly, the Golden Jackals of Africa have recently been split off as a distinct species, African Golden Wolf, on the basis that their genetics place them closer to wolves and coyotes. There is a good chance of photographing this newly ‘promoted’ wolf in this area.",
            "The open grasslands and acacia bushlands here are a stronghold of the stately, but declining Arabian Bustard, while other great birds to photograph include such restricted-range specialties as the huge Somali Ostrich, Hartlaub’s Bustard, and Somali Fiscal. If we are in luck we will come across an Arabian Bustard with one or more Northern Carmine Bee-eaters riding on its back! This truly extraordinary photographic highlight is dependent on how many bee-eaters are around. They use the bustards as convenient ‘lookout posts’ from which to hawk large flying insects. Somewhat surprisingly, the bustards seem to tolerate these colorful ‘hitch-hikers’.",

            "We will spend the early morning in the Bilen area before setting out for the Chercher Mountains and the city of Harar, where we will spend two nights. We will arrive in the afternoon in time to prepare for our first session this evening with the ‘Hyena Men’.",
            "Harar is an ancient city, known simply as Gey (‘the city’) to its inhabitants. The date of its foundation is unknown, but it was already important by the 13th century and later became the capital of the Adal Sultanate and its successor state, the Emirate of Harar, in the 16th century.",
            "Quite how the Hararis started feeding Spotted Hyenas is lost in legend, but it does seem they were tolerated and indeed encouraged in the city as nocturnal scavengers as far back as the 16th century, as low doorways were built at that time in the city walls to accommodate them! The various legends about feeding include stories that they were publicly fed porridge so that they could act as impromptu soothsayers through their style of eating it, or that they were fed to discourage them from eating livestock or even people during droughts, or even that Muslim saints communicated with their clan leaders and persuaded them not to do harm in return for handouts.",
            "In any event, it seems the feeding had long since stopped before it was revived in the 1950s or 1960s, perhaps through nothing more than chance encounters with hyenas and the inclination to see if they would accept food. Since then it has become a nightly event at Harar, with two senior ‘Hyena Men’, Mulugeta Wolde-Mariam and Yusuf Mume Saleh, and their assistants, operating at two different sites outside the walls.",
            "Spotted Hyenas have a fearsome reputation, only partly because of their manner and appearance, but also because of their ruthless hunting style in the wild, so seeing them come close to humans and take meat from small sticks held in what seems a tiny hand, next to their huge muzzles, or even a human mouth, seems pretty awesome to the rest of us! Not only do the hyenas take food but they ‘lovingly’ rest their huge paws on the Hyena Man’s back or head and generally behave like large friendly dogs!",
            "As well as being able to take photographs, at close range, of the Hyena Men and their nightly ‘guests’ from the surrounding forests (where the hyenas live a perfectly normal life for 23 hours a day), we will also be able to get great shots of them lurking in the background, resting before they feed or prowling in sinister fashion. If you are so inclined you can get down low for better angles (so far they have never eaten anyone!) and if you are really brave you will get the chance to feed them yourself.",
            "Needless to say, the whole experience is utterly unforgettable and a wildlife photography encounter that is completely unique.",

            "This morning there will be time to explore the ancient medina of Harar and its surrounding fortifications, known as the Jugal (or Jugol). The walled old city dates back to around the 16th century and is a fascinating warren of small alleyways, markets, mosques, and ancient buildings. Harar is widely considered to be the 4th holiest city in Islam, after Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem, but today it is famed for its tolerance of other faiths, and Harar beer, brewed naturally enough by Christians, is widely available. It is said that there are 99 mosques in Harar, chiming with the 99 known names of Allah, but in reality, there are ‘only’ 86. Harar is a wonderful place for photography, especially if you get out early while the light is at its best.",
            "We will also enjoy a photographic session with the ‘Kite Man’ of Harar. Feeding the Yellow-billed Kites is a recent development, not some ancient tradition, but it is fun to watch and photograph the kites swooping down and often squabbling in mid-air over small pieces of meat from the ‘Kite Man’s’ hands.",
            "During the late afternoon, we will try and find some of the Spotted Hyenas lurking in the dry woodland near the town prior to gathering for the evening feast. It will be good to have some daytime shots to balance the nocturnal spectacle. After dark, we will, of course, return for a second session outside the town walls with the ‘Hyena Men’, something none of us will ever forget!",

            "Your Ethiopian adventure commences with an early departure from Addis Ababa this morning, as we head south into the Great Rift Valley. Your first birding stop is at Lake Chelekcheka, an excellent site for migrant ducks and waders. Regular species encountered here include Northern Pintail, Northern Shoveler, Garganey, Eurasian Teal, Tufted Duck, Black-tailed Godwit and Temminck’s Stint. Sorting through the rafts of ducks and other migrants can be very challenging due to the distraction caused by the sheer number of species moving through the scrubby vegetation near the lake edge! Common cranes often roost in staggering numbers on the far side of the water, and we may see them flying off to forage in huge, noisy flocks. ",
            "The well-wooded rim of the deep Lake Hora will be our second stop. The woodlands around the lake also teem with birds and again it may prove difficult to keep up with the seemingly endless flow of lifers! Blue-breasted Bee-eater, Black-billed Barbet, Common Redstart, Eurasian Blackcap, Red-throated Wryneck, Dark-capped Yellow Warbler, Rüppell’s Robin-Chat, Western Black-headed Batis, Beautiful Sunbird, Rüppell’s Weaver and a diverse variety of waterbirds, especially deep water diving ducks, can be seen here. Thereafter, the steep-sided Lake Bishoftu offers superb birding. Maccoa and Ferruginous Ducks, Southern Pochard, Singing Cisticola, gorgeous Tacazze Sunbird, Mocking Cliff Chat, Abyssinian Wheatear, Little Rock Thrush and flocks of Black-winged Lovebird are just some of our targets here!

This habitat is termed ‘Afro-alpine moorland’ and is characterised by Giant Lobelias that tower like monolithic giants over the rich tussock grasslands and extensive cushions of yellow Everlasting flowers. This site is an Important Bird Area of immense significance, supporting seven globally threatened species and nearly all of Ethiopia’s highland biome species. The plateau holds the only Afro tropical breeding populations of Ruddy Shelduck, Golden Eagle, and Red-billed Chough.

            "These grasslands are estimated to support an incredible biomass of 4,000kg (8,800lb) of rodents per hectare. This obviously attracts an array of raptors and we should see Augur and Mountain Buzzards and, if we are lucky, the rare Golden Eagle. They share this abundant food source with the plateau’s most celebrated resident, the Ethiopian or Simien Wolf, crowned with the unenviable title of “the world’s rarest canid”. Watching these vibrantly coloured animals, most closely related to the Grey Wolf exhibiting their hunting prowess whilst pouncing on Giant Mole Rats (another endemic to the Sanetti Plateau) is surely among Africa’s greatest wildlife experiences. We should enjoy excellent photographic opportunities in this unique montane habitat.",
            "This afternoon, we will return to our lodge and enjoy an opportunity to bird a part of the vast Harenna forest, the largest intact forest block in Ethiopia, and the largest protected Afro-alpine forest on the continent. It still supports populations of Lion and the only surviving forest-dwelling African Wild Dogs. Although it’s unlikely that we will see either of these species, the descent through this breathtakingly beautiful, moss-draped forest is inspirational.",

The bird is named after an Italian Prince, its hapless discoverer, who was killed by an elephant soon after collecting the type specimen in the 1890s. It took another 50 years before explorers saw the turaco again, and only in the 1970s was anything revealed about this bird.

This area of the Acacia savanna is characterised by giant red termite mounds (some towering 5m above the plains!) and both these birds seem to be associated in some way with these marvels of natural architecture.

          description: [
            "An early departure from Debre Birhan is essential in order to be at our chosen site when the endemic Harwood’s Francolin is at its most vocal, thus providing our best opportunity for seeing this elusive species. ",
            "The Jemma River is one of the main tributaries of the Blue Nile and it cuts a 700m (2,300ft) deep gorge through the landscape. The habitat in the gorge is dominated by Acacia woodland, while the steep sides provide habitat for some excellent endemic birds. We will concentrate our search here for Rüppell’s Vulture, Verreaux’s Eagle, African Hawk-Eagle, Augur Buzzard (dark morph birds are commonly seen here), Lanner and Peregrine Falcons, Erckel’s Francolin, Nyanza Swift, Hemprich’s Hornbill, Red-rumped Swallow, Abyssinian Wheatear, the endemic and localised Rüppell’s Black Chat, endemic White-winged Cliff Chat and its more familiar cousin, Mocking Cliff Chat, endemic White-billed Starling, elusive Yellow-rumped Seedeater and Cinnamon-breasted Bunting. ",
            "We will have a picnic lunch at the river and bird the surrounding woodlands for Blue-spotted Wood Dove, Klaas’s Cuckoo, Black-billed Barbet, Eastern Olivaceous Warbler, Lesser Whitethroat, Foxy and Singing Cisticolas, African Paradise Flycatcher, Masked, Woodchat, and Isabelline Shrikes, Swainson’s Sparrow, Bush Petronia, Speckle-fronted Weaver, Red-collared Widowbird, Black-winged Red and Yellow Bishops, and both Crimson-rumped and Abyssinian Waxbills. With a good dose of luck, we may stumble upon the quiet and inconspicuous Red-billed Pytilia, one of the trickier endemics that is regularly found in the Jemma Valley. In the mid-afternoon, we will depart for the drive back to Addis Ababa.",
            "This evening we will enjoy a farewell dinner before departing on their international flights home.",
